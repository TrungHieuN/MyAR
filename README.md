# PlantAR - Online Shop with Augmented Reality

This mobile application is a combination of a online shop and Augmented Reality for further using experience. The products can be anything available for e-commerce that having interaction in real-time with real environment can help bring better using experience. In this project, plants and flowers are my main products.
