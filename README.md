PlantAR is a combination of a online shop and Augmented Reality for further using experience. The products can be anything available for e-commerce that possibly has interaction in real-time with real environment to help bring better using experience. In this project, plants and flowers are my main products. 

*This is just a prototype from my bachelor thesis.

## Project Introducktion

This project was carried out by myself, and the concept ideas was inspired by the “IKEA Place” application, which is an online shop for furniture and decorations, with Augmented-Reality technology for real-time preview and interaction. The products can be customized and stored in Real-time Firebase Database platfrom by Google, which is easy to access and supported with multiple data types. (Further information about Firebase Database: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/read-and-write).

In this prototype, only one 3D object is used and stored in local database of Android Studio. The aim of this part is to store these objects along with other products information in Real-time Database (Name, Product Image, Product Description, Product Price etc.).
